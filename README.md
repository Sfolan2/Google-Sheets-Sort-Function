# Google-Sheets-Sort-Function
This is a script that is used to organize a todo list. It takes data from my google sheet where I track my homework and gives it a score based on priority, due date and estimated length. Then I choose to sort by the score and all of the highest rated assignments go to the top and the lowest ones go to the bottom.
