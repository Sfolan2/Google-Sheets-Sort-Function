# Google-Sheets-Sort-Function
This is a script that is used to organize a todo list. It takes data from my google sheet where I track my homework and gives it a score based on priority, due date and estimated length. Then I have a second file which uses the onEdit trigger function so that it sorts by score everytime that the spreadsheet is changed.
